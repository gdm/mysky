# My sky (Challenge My Sky Color)


## Overview

The goal of this project is to involve as much people as possible for regulary making and uploading geotagged photos of the sky.

Complete solution for collecting photos of the sky can be devided into the following parts

  1.  Mobile application(s) that allows to make, geotag and upload photos
  2.  Server-side application/storage
  3.  Actions for encouraging people to help 

This project is mostly about the 3rd one.

## How to encourage people to help

Making photos of the sky and uploading them to the server is an additional work that most of the people try to avoid.

Doing the job of making photos will be more attractive if

 1.  Person undestands that by doing this he is making the world better.<br/>
     It should be enough information how the collected data is important.
 2.  It's easy to do.<br/>
     Mobile app and server-side should work smoothly and be easy to use.
 3.  It's fun to do.<br/>
     How to increase this (?)
 4.  It brings something valuable for him.</br>
     User should be able browse uploaded photos, share them in social networks/etc. <br/>
     Other services like sharing geoposition may be also integrated (as soon as uploaded photo of the sky will contains geotag) <br/>
     An additional disk space for the user may be given (depends of the number of uploaded sky photos)<br/>
 5.  He can share his achievment to others (+ involve another participants)<br/>
     It should be possible to get number of uploaded photos as a picture for showing the status


## What to demo:

 - emulation of mobile client as a curl/post
 - server side that store an uploaded photo (sign on / authentication)
 - facebook application with current uploaded photo/geo and 'score'
